**Continuous Improvement Rules for Meta-Cognitive Error Analyzer**

1. **Never assume X when the user asks Y**: When a user asks a question that requires a yes/no answer, analyze the question's intent and relevance to provide a clear answer.

2. **Always format Z using tags**: When a user provides a prompt with unclear or missing information, analyze the prompt's formatting and provide a clear answer with actionable tags.

3. **Watch for backend inconsistencies**: When a user reports an error in the backend, analyze the error's source and provide a clear solution.

4. **Check for hallucinations**: When a user reports a hallucination, analyze the hallucination's source and provide a clear solution.

5. **Analyze unclear user prompts**: When a user provides an unclear prompt, analyze the prompt's intent and provide a clear answer.

6. **Never provide unclear answers**: When a user reports an unclear answer, analyze the answer's source and provide a clear solution.

7. **Always ask for clarification**: When a user asks for clarification, analyze the question's intent and provide a clear answer.

8. **Watch for Meta-Cognitive errors**: When a user reports a Meta-Cognitive error, analyze the error's source and provide a clear solution.
